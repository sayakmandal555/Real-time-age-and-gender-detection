# Real-time-age-and-gender-detection
The computer vision technology of age and gender detection analyzes live videos or images to quickly determine the approximate age and gender of people in the footage. It does this by examining facial features like the shape of the face, eyes, nose, and mouth, then using machine learning models to classify these features based on age and gender patterns. Real-time systems need efficient algorithms to process video frames rapidly and provide instant results. Age estimation categorizes people into groups like child, teenager, adult, and elderly, while gender detection simply identifies someone as male or female. This technology has many uses, such as in surveillance, marketing, and tailoring user experiences by delivering personalized content and demographic analysis.
